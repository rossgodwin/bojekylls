*Bojekylls* is a Jekyll theme that can be used to quickly create a static website. The name *Bojekylls* is a play on the name of a fast food restaurant in the southeastern part of the United States, *Bojangles*, a favorite fast food restaurant of the author.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} is a static site generator. A static site generator is a tool that creates all the website content based on raw data and templates. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator){:target="_blank"} has a nice article explaining static websites, static site generators and the pros and cons.

The user interface generated by this theme is a responsive UI, so all the content is designed to render on any possible screen size. To achieve this *Bojekylls* utilizes CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box) Layout, CSS Grid Layout and a very nice 3rd party library Masonry Grid Layout framework.
