This website is a static site that I created using HTML, CSS, Jekyll, Javascript and other 3rd party libraries.

The following is true of this website as of the publish date of this post. A static website is a site that serves the content exactly as it is stored on the server, in contrast to a dynamic website that generates the content as it is requested by the user's web browser. For this reason, static site pages should load very fast. Static websites are easy and fun to create, inexpensive to host and and perfect to use for a personal website. The purpose of this website is to contain blog postings, information about my career and a avenue for me to improve my web design skills. As I was initially thinking about this site, I wanted to put it together without using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com){:target="_blank"}. The reason being I wanted to create my own library of components and I wanted to use this as a opportunity to get better at using raw HTML and CSS.
