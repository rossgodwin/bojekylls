## About

*Bojekylls* is a Jekyll theme that can be used to quickly create a static website.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} is a static site generator. A static site generator is a tool that creates all the website content based on raw data and templates. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator){:target="_blank"} has a nice article explaining static websites, static site generators and the pros and cons.

The user interface generated by this them is a responsive UI, so all the content is designed to render on any possible screen size. To achieve this *Bojekylls* utilizes CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box) Layout, CSS Grid Layout and a very nice 3rd party library Masonry Grid Layout framework. Also, breakpoints are used as triggering points to reorganize the content on the screen. Breakpoint widths I used are 576px, 768px, 992px, 1200px and 1400px.
